            <p>Epaminondas was a Theban general, most widely known for his defeat of Sparta at the battle of Leuctra. Born into relatively modest wealth for a Hellenic statesman, Epaminondas was known for his love of philosophy.</p>
            <p>Spartans had long been the dominant military power in Greece when they faced Epaminondas on the battlefield at Leuctra in 371 BC. After defeating Sparta at Leuctra, Epaminondas and Pelopidas freed Sparta's helots, which Sparta was reliant on for labour.</p>
