            <p>The fourth century BC saw Athens and Sparta damaged following their conflict in the Peloponnesian War. Thebes' influence as a Hellenic power grew as a result.</p>
            <p>Although Thebes' uprising and hegemony was relatively short, it nonetheless had profound significance. The defeat of Sparta enabled the freeing of Sparta's helots - people of Lakonia and Messenia with slave status.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas and Pelopidas led Thebes during this period. Their freeing of Sparta's helots alone merits their remembrance as significant figures.</p>
